Tree Monitoring - Dashboard
======

**An interactive Dashboard for monitoring of Community Trees - a tool for monitoring climate mitigation through Urban Forestry.**

Submission for the ESRI Hack for Sustainable Future

Description 
------------

We have mapped urban vegetation cover in part of Lilongwe (Malawi's admnistrative capital). In addition to this, we also present information about tree survival using data generated through a citizen science approach.

We have utilized ESRI ArcGIS JavaScript API to develop a dashboard for communicating this information.  

Our main goal is to develop reliable set of tools  that can enable monitoring, communicating and verification of carbon storage. With regard to the current project, we seek to provide visual information about the status of urban vegetation cover to an environmental Youth Club so as to guide their efforts in building a better and sustainable world. This tool can serve as a rapid and reliable platform for communicating urban greenification efforts, reporting achievements and impact of tree planting programs. Essentially enabling identification of opportunities to improving management of existing tree planting programs.
