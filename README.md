Tree Monitoring - Dashboard
======

**An interactive Dashboard for monitoring of survival of Trees - a tool for monitoring climate mitigation through tree planting.**

Submission for the ESRI Hack for Sustainable Future

Description 
------------

We have utilized ESRI ArcGIS JavaScript API to develop a dashboard for monitoring and communicating tree survival. The data is visualized in a dashboard that has been developed using ArcGIS Javascript API. 

Our main goal is to develop reliable set of tools  that can enable monitoring, communicating and verification of carbon storage through tree planting.
With regard to ESRI hack for sustainable future hackathon, we used data that was captured by an environmental Youth Club in Lilongwe City in Africa to develop an interactive dashboard for monitoring survival of newly planted trees over time. This tool can serve as a reliable platform for communicating achievements and impact of a tree planting program and also enable identification of opportunities to improving management of existing tree planting programs.
